# UXD â€“ Modern CSS

This site is a helpful resource for everythingwe discuss in our lesson. But also if you are interested it is a potentially interesting resource for development itself.

## This site

This site is built with a javascript library called [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). Its a really good library and one that is more beginner friendly than others.

## Run this site 'locally'

To run this local, download it and you will need to run some commands on the _Command Line_ (its called 'Terminal' on Mac OS). You will also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

Find this folder and run:

```
npm install
```

and then when thats finished run:

```
npm run dev
```

That will run the build task of svelte and also start a server to view the site locally. It will be at `http://localhost:5000`
